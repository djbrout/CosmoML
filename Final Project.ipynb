    "# Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final project, your task is to predict the type of galaxies based on a number of measurements and calculations about the images of the galaxies.  This is similar to the [Galaxy Zoo](http://zoo1.galaxyzoo.org/) project we discussed in class, but rather than starting from the images themselves, we are starting with some properties of the galaxies measured from the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are fully described in [Fischer et al (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02580), a recent paper by several U. Penn researchers, including Helena Dominguez-Sanchez, whom you met in class on April 17.\n",
    "Don't worry.  You don't need to read that paper to do this project.  Helena explained the important aspects of the data in class.  (Her slides are available on [canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/files/76244434/).)  But if you feel inspired to read more about it, please do take a look at the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fischer et al paper describes quite a lot of measurements based on different kinds of fits to the images.  We have extracted a subset of the measurements into a smaller catalog, which should be easier for you to work with.  Specifically, we selected columns related to the bulge + disk decomposition of the galaxy (called SE for Sersic + Exponential in the paper).\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in this catalog are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* id = A numeric ID identifying the galaxy\n",
    "* gal_type = Which type of galaxy this is.  We discuss this more below.\n",
    "* ra = Right Ascension in degrees.  Kind of like longitude on the sky.\n",
    "* dec = Declination in degrees.  Like latitude on the sky.\n",
    "* redshift = A measure of how far away the galaxy is.\n",
    "* log_luminosity = Base 10 logarithm of the galaxy's brightness (aka luminosity) measured as a multiple of the sun's luminosity.\n",
    "* color = Lr / Lg, the ratio of the luminosity at red wavelengths to the luminosity at green wavelengths.\n",
    "* radius = The half-light radius of the galaxy (called Re in Helena's slides) according to the bulge + disk fit in kiloparsecs (kpc; see below for definition of kpc).\n",
    "* b_over_a = The ratio of the semi-minor axis of the galaxy (b) to the semi-major axis (a).  b_over_a = 1 is a circle. b_over_a close to 0 is a very elongated ellipse.\n",
    "* pos_angle = The position angle of the semi-minor axis of the galaxy on the sky in degrees.\n",
    "* bulge_fract = The fraction of the total light that was found to be in the bulge component (called B/T in Helena's slides).\n",
    "* sersic_n = The Sersic index of the bulge component of the fit.\n",
    "* r_bulge = The half-light radius of the bulge component of the fit in kiloparsecs (kpc).\n",
    "* r_disk = The half-light radius of the disk component of the fit in kiloparsecs (kpc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Radii are given in kpc above, a common distance unit used by astronomers. For reference, 1 kpc = 1000 pc, and 1 pc = 3.26 light years.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "The gal_type column is your target (y).  The others you may use as your predictors (x_i).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the galaxy type, we distilled the morphological classification described in Fischer et al into 4 broad categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* gal_type = 1 are elliptical galaxies.  In the paper, these are called E.  They have TTYPE <= 0 and P_S0 <= 0.5.\n",
    "* gal_type = 2 are lenticular galaxies.  In the paper, these are called S0.  They have TTYPE <= 0 and P_S0 > 0.5.\n",
    "* gal_type = 3 are tight spiral galaxies.  In the paper, these are described as 0 < TType < 3.  We will call them S1.\n",
    "* gal_type = 4 are loose spiral galaxies.  In the paper, these are described as TType > 3.  We will call them S2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in addition to the catalog described above, we are also providing the complete catalog described in Fischer et al for g and r bands.  You are not required to use it, but you may do so if you want."

    "For the first stage of the project, we'll start with the easier task of just distinguishing the two most extreme galaxy types: 1 vs 4, or E vs S2.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any of the various characterization methods we have used throughout the course to do the prediction.  (Or even ones we haven't covered if you feel so inclined.)  You should write two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* train_galaxy_predictions takes as input a set of training data and returns some results, which can be used to make predictions.\n",
